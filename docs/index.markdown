<center><h1><b>M2 MoSIG</b></h1><h2>Academic year <b>2025/2026</b></h2></center>

The objective of the Master of Science at Grenoble is to offer to all students, regardless of country of origin, access to world-class graduate training in areas of Informatics where the scientific research in industry and academia in Grenoble is particularly strong.

This program is offered jointly by [Grenoble INP Ensimag](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/en) school of engineering in Applied Mathematics and Informatics and the Department of Informatics and Mathematics of [Université Grenoble Alpes, IM²AG](https://im2ag.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/).

MoSIG is a highly competitive, two-year European Standard (LMD) graduate program. This page is dedicated to the second year of the master. For the first year please refer to [M1 website](https://m1-mosig.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr).

The first semester  offers the possibility to choose among two specializations: [Cloud Computing & Data Infrastructures](/ccdi/) and [Applied Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Systems](/applied_ai/)
