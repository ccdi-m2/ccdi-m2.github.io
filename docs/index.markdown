<center><h1><b>M2 MoSIG</b></h1><h2>Academic year <b>2025/2026</b></h2></center>

The objective of the Master of Science at Grenoble is to offer to all students, regardless of country of origin, access to world-class graduate training in areas of Informatics where the scientific research in industry and academia in Grenoble is particularly strong.

This program is offered jointly by [Grenoble INP Ensimag](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/en) school of engineering in Applied Mathematics and Informatics and the Department of Informatics and Mathematics of [Université Grenoble Alpes, IM²AG](https://im2ag.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/).

MoSIG is a highly competitive, two-year European Standard (LMD) graduate program. This page is dedicated to the second year of the master. For the first year please refer to [M1 website](https://m1-mosig.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr).

<blockquote>
<p>Coursework is offered in English, and the program is open to top students holding a BSc in Computer Engineering or Computer Science (European LMD Licence), a degree in engineering, or an equivalent degree, from any country.</p>

<p>For admission refer to the <a href="https://relint.imag.fr/MainEn/Admission"><b>admission section</b></a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Program</h2>

<p>MoSIG 2 program is divided in two semesters (9 and 10).</p>

<b>Semester 9</b> offers the possibility to choose among two specializations: [Cloud Computing & Data Infrastructures](/ccdi/) and [Applied Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Systems](/applied_ai/)

- <h3>Theme 1: <b>Cloud Computing & Data Infrastructures</b> (<a href="/ccdi/">Web page</a>)</h3>
<table border="1" style="background-color:#FFFFE0;">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Description</b>: Provides students with an education in designing, implementing, and optimizing cutting-edge technologies for managing large-scale data systems, cloud-based solutions and Information Security. This program equips graduates with the skills and knowledge to excel as Cloud Engineers, Data Architects, or IT Security Specialists, ready to address the challenges of a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Students can tailor their learning by selecting specialization modules allowing them to dive deeper into their areas of interest.
